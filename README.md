# mern-template

A template repository for a MongoDB - Express - React (w/ Redux) - Node project.

## Unsolicited advice
I'd heavily recommend working through building a similar repo for yourself from scratch, rather than blindly using this template to ensure that you know how it all interacts and what each line of code/config is doing.

## CAVEATS
1. This is using syntax from an older version of react/redux.
2. This has not had any real testing, there are and will be errors.
3. This repo may be under active development and in a broken state at any point in time.
